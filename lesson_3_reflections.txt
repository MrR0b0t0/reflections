when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

to use as a central repository for when using multiple computers and have multiple users working on the same project.
this also allows you to be mobile. working anywhere that as an internet connection a be able to sync.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Same reason you dont want automatic saves done locally. you dont want random saves here and there which are hard to track
and use. you want to save when it make sense at a particular milestone or a group of changes.
